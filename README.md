# CNC Mill

## Goal

I want to have a CNC mill. I've considered buying one, but everything I can find violates one or more of the following constraints:

- **Budget:** It's going to be my first, so spending a lot of money doesn't make a whole lot of sense. The main purpose is to learn, and figure out what I actually need in a CNC mill.
- **Capability:** At the same time, I don't want to buy a machine that I will outgrow within the first week. It should be capable of cutting aluminium relatively comfortably.
- **Space:** I'm severely limited on space. It needs to comfortably fit on a desk (while not taking up the whole desk).
- **Environment:** I don't have a proper workshop, unfortunately. The machine will need to run in my apartment, preferably without making my neighbors hate me.

There simply doesn't seem to be a machine like this, which is not a surprise. For this reason, I'd like to try and build my own, purpose-made for my use case.

I suspect it might simply be impossible to fulfill all of these requirements at within limited budget. If that is the case, I'm looking forward to learning what the limitations are specifically. I'm also aware that there's a high risk that a self-built machine will fall short in some or all of these areas. I think it's still likely to be a better investment, for the learning experience alone.


## Status

As of this writing, I've literally just started. This README exists, and nothing else.


## Research Notes

These are the notes from my research process.

### CAD Software

I'd love to use [Fornjot](https://www.fornjot.app/) for this, but it'll be a while before it's ready for a project like this. I hope that I can migrate the project to Fornjot eventually.

Normally, I'd favor open source software, but since migration to Fornjot at a later stage is planned anyway, I don't see that as a priority right now. I've used OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, SolveSpace, and other open source options in the past, and I'd like to take this opportunity to try something new.

I'm focusing the research on options that are free (or have a free tier) and support Linux:

- OnShape: https://www.onshape.com/
  Looks highly professional. Would certainly be an interesting learning experience.
- SketchUp: https://sketchup.com/
  Also looks interesting, although the website presents architecture and furniture use cases, versus the mechanical assemblies showcased on the OnShape website. Hard to say how relevant this will be for this project.
- TinkerCAD: https://www.tinkercad.com/
  Looks least interesting, judging from the website, as it stresses the beginner/education use case. Doesn't mean that it won't be more than capable enough for this project though.
