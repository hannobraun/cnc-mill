# CNC Mill

## About

I'm building my own CNC mill. I'm using this repository to manage the research, planning, and design that goes into it.


## Status

As of this writing, I've literally just started. This README exists, and nothing else.


## Research Notes

These are the notes from my research process.

### CAD Software

I'd love to use [Fornjot](https://www.fornjot.app/) for this, but it'll be a while before it's ready for a project like this. I hope that I can migrate the project to Fornjot eventually.

Normally, I'd favor open source software, but since migration to Fornjot at a later stage is planned anyway, I don't see that as a priority right now. I've used OpenSCAD, FreeCAD, SolveSpace, and other open source options in the past, and I'd like to take this opportunity to try something new.

I'm focusing the research on options that are free (or have a free tier) and support Linux:

- OnShape: https://www.onshape.com/
  Looks highly professional. Would certainly be an interesting learning experience.
- SketchUp: https://sketchup.com/
  Also looks interesting, although the website presents architecture and furniture use cases, versus the mechanical assemblies showcased on the OnShape website. Hard to say how relevant this will be for this project.
- TinkerCAD: https://www.tinkercad.com/
  Looks least interesting, judging from the website, as it stresses the beginner/education use case. Doesn't mean that it won't be more than capable enough for this project though.
