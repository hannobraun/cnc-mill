//! Calculations for the CNC mill
//!
//! This is basically a Rust program, in the form of a [Fornjot] model, that
//! does some calculations about the CNC mill, to help to select right-sized
//! components.
//!
//! So, why is this a Fornjot model? Honestly, is doesn't make a whole lot of
//! sense, if viewed in isolation. Fornjot doesn't have the features yet to
//! model the CNC mill's geometry, and it has no simulation features at all. It
//! doesn't really support anything I'm using it for here, and I'd probably be
//! better off just doing it in Excel.
//!
//! However, I want to use Fornjot for modeling the CNC mill (or its successor)
//! in the future, and it makes sense to do this kind of calculation together
//! with the CAD model. I also want Fornjot to at least not stand in the way of
//! use cases outside of its (current) core feature that, and using it for
//! something it wasn't designed for should help there.
//!
//! Lastly, I usually only work on Fornjot itself, within its repository. Using
//! it for something new outside of the repository was already hugely
//! informative, in regards to some weaknesses it has, and where it might trip
//! new users up.
